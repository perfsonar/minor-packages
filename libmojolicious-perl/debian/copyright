 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the Artistic License, which comes with Perl.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
     Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided
     that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
     Standard Version of this Package in any medium without
     restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided
     that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
     associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies
     may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
     modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The
     resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version,
     and as such will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
     or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of
     the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it
     differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to,
     documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules,
     and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
    (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that
        the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the
        Standard Version.
    (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version.
        In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is
        different from the name of the Standard Version.
    (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to
        others under
        (i)  the Original License or
        (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
             modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the
             same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the
             licensee received, and requires that the Source form of
             the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
             be made freely available in that license fees are
             prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
     the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on
     how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions
     must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these
     instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such
     distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions
     on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid
     instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you
     become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not
     forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
     the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect
     to the Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
     Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the
     resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing
     fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing
     fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The
     terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the
     Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
     other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own,
     or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of
     applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result
     without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct
     interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
     merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves,
     cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such
     works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are
     not subject to the terms of this license.
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
      Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By
      using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this
      license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you
      do not accept this license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
      Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless
      required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with
      the requirements of this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
      service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
      free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
      sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to
      any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are
      necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent
      litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against
      any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or
      contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to
      you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.
 .
 (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
      HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE

      DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN
      IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

     License.
  i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

     under this Public License.
  k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or

     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
  m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 – Scope.
 .
  a. License grant.
 .
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
            A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and
            B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section
          2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
       5. Downstream recipients.
 .
            A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.
            B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
               under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
            C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.
 .
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
  b. Other rights.
 .
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 – License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
 .
            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:
 .
                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                   Material and any others designated to receive
                   attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                   the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
                ii. a copyright notice;
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;
                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                   extent reasonably practicable;
 .
            B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
 .
  b. ShareAlike.
 .
     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
       1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.
       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
     YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  c. the disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.
  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
